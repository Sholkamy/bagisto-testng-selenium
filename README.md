# Bagisto Common – Selenium POM Regression Project

## Description
This project demonstrates end‑to‑end UI test automation for the **Bagisto** demo site (`bagisto-common`). It showcases best practices for building a scalable and maintainable Selenium framework using the **Page Object Model (POM)** and **TestNG**, with the goal of covering a full regression cycle for core e‑commerce flows.

## Overview
This project provides hands‑on experience in building a comprehensive UI testing framework for a modern web application. Key aspects include:

* **UI Testing Fundamentals:** Robust locating strategies, explicit waits, clear assertions for reliable verification, and others.
* **POM Architecture:** Clean separation of concerns with reusable page objects to improve readability, maintenance, and scalability.
* **Regression Test Suite:** Expanding coverage across critical flows (e.g., **Customer Registration** implemented; upcoming: login, product search, cart, checkout, and account management).
* **TestNG Integration:** Suite configuration, grouped execution, and parallel runs managed by `testng.xml`, with rich reports.
